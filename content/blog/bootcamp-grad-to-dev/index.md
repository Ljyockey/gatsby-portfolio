4 months after graduating from Thinkful, I have accepted a job offer as a Frontend Developer here in Los Angeles! I will share more details about the company once I have a better idea of their social media policies, but I can say that it’s very close to the beach in Santa Monica. A nice change of scenery after spending the last 4 1/2 years in Las Vegas.

Job-hunting, to me, was harder than the bootcamp itself. The constant uncertainty was an emotional challenge. I can’t stress enough the importance of having a strong support system while job-hunting. I was very fortunate that between Thinkful’s career services and my friends, I had a lot of support. There were two reasons why a support system was unexpectedly valuable:

1. **They kept my feet on the ground when I found the perfect opportunity**. This may sound cheesy, but from the moment I arrived at the first interview with my new company, I knew immediately that this was where I wanted to work. I got along well with all of my soon-to-be peers and the product is interesting to me. My support system kept me from getting overwhelmed by the excitement of a new opportunity and helped me ensure that I was prepared for the interview.
2. **They kept me from accepting horrible offers**. I’m sure it’s no secret that the longer we look for a job, the more likely we are to accept any offer, even if it’s one we don’t necessarily want. The reality is that I would not have been happy with any company I had previously met with. Whether it was the location, lack of growth opportunities, or culture, each company had a major red flag indicating that I may not be happy there as an employee. My support system kept me from taking an unsatisfactory offer (the last thing I would have wanted to do was continue the job-hunt after starting a brand new job!).

There are so many different things that a new developer can do to ensure that they stand out amongst all of the other entry-level applicants. What worked for me may not necessarily work for other people based on a variety of factors (culture, openings, location, etc). That being said, if I had to pinpoint the most important factors in my job hunt, they’d be *networking and interview skills*.

### Networking
We’ve seen it everywhere. It’s all over LinkedIn and all of the career coaches are preaching it: the best way to get a job is through your network (or at least by reaching out to “real ” people). I interviewed with approximately 10–15 companies over the last 4 months. Out of those 10–15, only 2 interviews resulted without reaching out to any of the company’s employees. After weeks of sending applications via LinkedIn, I finally got a notification that one of my applications had been viewed. I was previously unaware of that notification, which meant it took weeks before I realized that most of my applications weren’t even being viewed. It was at this point that I got much more aggressive about reaching out to individual people from companies. Rarely would I submit an application without also sending an email to either a Tech Manager or HR Rep. I got a lot more responses once I started sending emails.

### Interview Skills
As I mentioned in my [previous post](https://medium.com/@Ljyockey/new-developers-dont-make-the-same-mistake-i-did-e1eb2f280218), interview skills (whiteboarding/fundamentals) were a weak spot for me. While I was comfortable coding projects, I fumbled miserably when asked to explain Javascript vocabulary or write out functions on an unfamiliar surface like a whiteboard. I naively wrote in my previous post that I didn’t think these skills were necessary to being a good developer. Nonetheless, I started spending more time on CodeWars; I was surprised by the result. Not only was it an entertaining way to kill an extra 15 minutes, but I found myself getting better acquainted with Javascript methods and prototypes I had forgotten about and thus wasn’t using in my day-to-day code. Also, the more I did these exercises, the more comfortable I became with any new problem, whether it be at home or in an interview. I can’t help but wonder what kind of developer I’d be today if I’d started using CodeWars 6 months ago when it was initially suggested to me (better late than never, right?).

### Conclusion
Of course, these conclusions took a couple of months and many failed interviews. I hated hearing that I just needed to keep doing what I was doing and that ultimately I’d start getting more interviews and offers, but that was generally the case. It was only once I had more interviews that I had a better idea of what needed to be improved. Timing wasn’t on my side either, as most companies stop hiring towards the end of the year. I spent more time networking and working on my coding skills once Thanksgiving hit, which was what ultimately led to my accepted job offer. Whatever the formula is for you, stick with it, and know that there is a community of people out here waiting to help you!
