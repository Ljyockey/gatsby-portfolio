I first learned about coding during summer 2015. Now, at the beginning of 2018, I‘ve officially worked 3 weeks as a developer. So, how was it?!

### Week 1
Monday, January 8 was my first day. I was given a company laptop, which took two whole days to get fully setup as a functional dev environment. By Wednesday, I was in the codebase building a new React component. Similar to the bootcamp days, diving into code was the best way to learn. I’ve been learning more and more about the codebase the more I’m in it. Some bugs came up on Thursday and Friday. Nothing serious, just enough to dive even deeper into the codebase. The first week was mostly me getting familiarized with the new workplace. I was terrified the entire time that I was actually unqualified for the job, but my mentor assured me that he didn’t see any red flags from me in my first week.

### Week 2
Now that I’d become a little more familiarized with the current project, I was able to dive into unit and functional tests. I got to start learning Kotlin, which has been a fun challenge so far.
At this point, I started to branch out of my bubble and started to look at work environment as a whole. I started getting familiarized with the role that different departments played in their interactions with my team. I explored Jira and poked around at some of the tickets. Rachel, my Thinkful mentor and good friend, wrote a great piece on things to know before starting your first dev job. I highly recommend it!
I hit my first brick wall during this week. Some changes we had made to an existing component caused some functional tests to fail and I couldn’t figure out why. I tried everything I could think of. I Googled the issue from what felt like a million different angles and couldn’t find anything. It didn’t help that the debugger message was extremely cryptic. Self-doubt crept up and hit me pretty hard at this point. After a couple of hours of trying to debug, I was convinced that I didn’t have what it took to do this job. I wanted to go home and curl into a ball forever.
I learned a valuable lesson that day: If I can’t figure out a problem, it might not be because I’m a bad developer. It might just be an extremely difficult problem to solve. When my mentor returned from his meetings and discovered that I was still stuck on the failing tests, he took a shot at it and couldn’t figure it out either. We paired up and eventually solved the problem, but it was incredibly reassuring to see that my mentor, with years of experience and deep familiarity with the codebase, also struggled. I also got to see firsthand the power of working with a team.

### Week 3
I made my first Merge Request! The merge was about a week late, but that was because of blockers. The merge request was approved and I officially have my name on the list of contributors in the package.json file. I still have a lot to do to get up-to-speed with the many projects and codebases that my team handles, but I’m feeling more confident that I can do it. I also feel a lot more comfortable asking my team questions. I don’t worry that I’m bothering them anymore.
The most important takeaway of these first few weeks was to remember to only handle what’s in front of me. Just like while I was at Thinkful, if I attempt to tackle everything at once, I’ll get overwhelmed. If I break down everything I need to learn and handle it one step at a time, I’m sure I’ll be just fine.
This time last year, I hadn’t even enrolled with Thinkful yet. Now, I’m a professional Frontend Developer. Thank you to everyone at Thinkful and the various online Dev communities that supported me through this process. My life is so surreal now that I’m in a perpetual state of waiting for the other shoe to drop.
