description: My last frontend assignments
---

This week, I wrapped up my work in [Thinkful’s](thinkful.com) Front-End course. I made some changes to my Capstone, [Kitty Opinions](https://ljyockey.github.io/kitty-opinions/), after receiving feedback from the Thinkful staff. I also worked on extra assignments, a basic [Tic Tac Toe](https://ljyockey.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) game and a [Logo Search](https://github.com/Ljyockey/logo-search). I feel much more comfortable with semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and functional JavaScript programming now than I did 5 weeks ago.

I also took this time to get better-organized. I added Thinkful to my [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/ljyockey) account, arranged the repositories on my [GitHub](github.com/ljyockey) account to better showcase my work, and installed a linter for Sublime Text to make the time I spent coding more efficient. The linter proved to be a daunting task, as syntax errors in my user settings (I need a linter for my linter) yielded unfavorable results. I blamed this struggle and many others unrelated to coding (like trying a hot sauce with a liability waiver on the label) on the multiple planets currently in retrograde.

I have become more comfortable with the idea that syntax errors are a part of life as a developer. I used to beat myself up over these errors. Now, I can laugh them off and continue to move forward. Overall, I’m glad that I installed a linter, but I will miss the debugging process that resulted in [tweets](twitter.com/Ljyockey) like this:

Now, it’s time to move on to server-side development and learning about Node.js. The fact that I have zero experience in back-end development is making me both nervous and excited for what’s to come. I have the utmost confidence that I will be able to get through it and gain much more knowledge and experience with the help of Thinkful’s curriculum and my awesome mentor, [Rachel](https://twitter.com/CodingLady).

…Of course, when I hear “back-end”, all I can think about is one of the jokes on Disneyland’s Jungle Cruise.

Thanks to Thinkful, I’m feeling confident about my future in Web Development. So much so, that I have withdrawn all of my applications to I.T. jobs in LA, and have postponed my move until after graduation so that I don’t have to pause my coursework. In other words, I’m all in!
